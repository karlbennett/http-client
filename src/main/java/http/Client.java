/**
 * A simple {@code HTTP} client API that can be used to make request to any {@code HTTP 1.0/1.1} server.
 *
 * The most commonly used types have been defined statically within this class so in most cases only one import is
 * required to use the API.
 *
 * {@code import static http.Client.*}
 *
 * This will provide access to all the static request methods
 * ({@link #GET(String)}, {@link #POST(String)}, {@link #PUT(String)}...) as well as the  ({@link Request} and
 * {@link Response} objects.
 *
 * The simplest way to use the client is through the static methods, these use a singleton instance of the client. This
 * singleton isn't instantiated until one of the static methods are used.
 *
 * Usage:
 * <code>System.out.println(GET("http://yoursite.com"))}</code>
 *
 * <code>
 *     Request request = new Request("http://yourservice.com/post");
 *     request.addHeader(new ContentType("application/x-www-form-urlencoded"));
 *     request.setBody(new Parameter("some", "thing"));
 *     POST(request);
 * </code>
 *
 * The singleton client can be configured with the {@link Configuration} instance returned or set by the
 * {@link #SET_CONFIGURATION} or {@link #GET_CONFIGURATION} methods respectively. It also automatically picks up the uses the
 * JVM SSL and proxy properties.
 * Proxy:
 * <code>
 *     http.proxyHost
 *     http.proxyPort
 *     http.nonProxyHosts
 *     https.proxyHost
 *     https.proxyPort
 *     https.nonProxyHosts
 *     socksProxyHost
 *     socksProxyPort
 * </code>
 *
 * SSL:
 * <code>
 *     javax.net.ssl.trustStore
 *     javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType
 *     javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword
 *     javax.net.ssl.keyStore
 *     javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType
 *     javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword
 * </code>
 *
 * If multiple client configuration profiles are required a new instance of the {@code Client} class can be created for
 * each and configured individually using the instance {@link #getConfiguration} and {@link #setConfiguration} methods. The
 * instance HTTP request methods would then be used ({@link #get(String), #post(String), #put(String)...}).
 *
 * Usage:
 * <code>System.out.println(new Client().get("http://yoursite.com"))}</code>
 *
 * <code>
 *     Request request = new Request("http://yourservice.com/post");
 *     request.addHeader(new ContentType("application/x-www-form-urlencoded"));
 *     request.setBody(new Parameter("some", "thing"));
 *     new Client().post(request);
 * </code>
